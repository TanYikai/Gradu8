## Promotional Poster
The idea came about as I spent 1 year in school and felt that it was like a race against time with deadlines and assignments always breathing down your neck. With that in mind, we decided to create a game based on this premise because why not ~.~ . It is made with unity and is summarized by the poster shown below.
